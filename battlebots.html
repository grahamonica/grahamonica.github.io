    <h2>Awards</h2>
    <p>30 lb National Champion (February 2025 NHRL, April 2024 NHRL), 2nd place 2024 World Champion, currently the highest ranked 30 lb combat robot (as of February 2025)</p>
    
    <h2>Machining Experience</h2>

    <p>I joined RoboJackets during the third iteration of Chonkiv. Although it is currently the highest ranked combat robot in the 30 lb category, when I joined it was a...</p>
    
    <h2>Python Design Simulation</h2>
    <p>Recently I created a Python simulation to optimize shuffler parameters for a new robot that we are releasing in April. This runs a shuffler simulation that I use to optimize the drive system for my robots. Everyone else is welcome to use this to optimize their robots, but please give credit if you do.</p>
    <p>A shuffler system uses offset cams so the robot will "walk" instead of roll.</p>
    
    <h3>Simulation vs Real-world Example</h3>

    <p>The system returns the lowest point variance and 360-degree stepover.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lowest point variance:</strong> Measures the vibration of the robot by calculating how much the robot "bounces" as it walks.</li>
        <li><strong>360-degree stepover:</strong> The distance that the robot travels per 360-degree rotation of the camshaft. This determines the robot's speed and the necessary motor torque to operate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design for Manufacturing</h2>
    <p>I also learned how to design components to be manufactured, tolerancing based on the type of machining.</p>
