            <p>- 30 lb National Champion (February 2025 NHRL, April 2024 NHRL)</p>
            <p>- 2nd place 2024 30 lb World Championships</p>
            <p>- highest ranked 30 lb combat robot (as of February 2025)</p>

            <img class="responsive-img" src="images/anglegrinding.jpg" alt="Machining Experience">
            <p>I joined RoboJackets during the third iteration of Chonkiv. Although it is currently the highest ranked combat robot in the 30 lb category, when I joined it was an early version with a losing combat record. Throughout the process of creating the latest iteration, I learned how to lathe, waterjet, use a manual mill, and a variety of hand tools such as the one pictured.</p>

            <h2>Python Design Simulation</h2>
            <p>Recently I created a Python simulation to optimize shuffler parameters for a new robot that we are releasing in April. This runs a shuffler simulation that I use to optimize the drive system for my robots. Everyone else is welcome to use this to optimize their robots, but please give credit if you do.</p>
            <p>A shuffler system uses offset cams so the robot will "walk" instead of roll.</p>

            <p>The system returns the lowest point variance and 360-degree stepover.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lowest point variance:</strong> Measures the vibration of the robot by calculating how much the robot "bounces" as it walks.</li>
                <li><strong>360-degree stepover:</strong> The distance that the robot travels per 360-degree rotation of the camshaft. This determines the robot's speed and the necessary motor torque to operate.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Design for Manufacturing</h2>
            <p>I also learned how to design components to be manufactured, tolerancing based on the type of machining.</p>
